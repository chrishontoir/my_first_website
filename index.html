          <h1>Interests</h1>
          <p>I play three musical instruments: piano, violin and clarinet, although I consider piano to be my main instrument. I enjoy writing music for piano and listening to film scores.<br>I also enjoy reading horror books, watching movies, and want to start learning another language.</p>

          <h1>Coding</h1>
          <p>I first started coding in Visual Basic for A Level Computing. I created a booking system for a cinema that allowed customers to select their seats, complete their booking and print their tickets.<br>Since then I self-taught myself HTML, CSS and a very small amount of JavaScript to create websites myself.</p>
